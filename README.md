This repository contains the logo of the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia (COSIMA).

Different file formats and versions of the logo are provided:

- [PDF](https://github.com/COSIMA/logo/tree/master/pdf)
- [PNG](https://github.com/COSIMA/logo/tree/master/png)
- [SVG](https://github.com/COSIMA/logo/tree/master/svg)

The COSIMA logo was created by Josué Martínez Moreno ([@josuemtzmo](https://github.com/josuemtzmo)) after consultation and costructive discussions with the COSIMA community. The logo encapsulates the meaning of COSIMA, in particular the words “Ocean", "Sea Ice", and "Australia”.
