# COSIMA Logo

This repository contains the logo of the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia (COSIMA).

Different file formats and versions of the logo are provided:

- PNG

- SVG

The COSIMA logo was created by Josué Martínez Moreno ([@josuemtzmo](https://github.com/josuemtzmo)) after consultation and costructive discussions with the COSIMA community. The logo encapsulates the meaning of COSIMA, in particular the words “Ocean, Sea Ice, and Australia”.
